<b> Ingredients: </b>
<ul>
  <li> 6 hard boiled eggs </li>
<li> 5 tbsps vegetable/ canola/ sunflower cooking oil </li>
<li>2 medium sized onion cut into quarters</li>
<li>3 medium sized tomatoes cut into quarters</li>
<li>2 green chillies</li>
<li>2 tsps garlic paste</li>
<li>2 tsps ginger paste</li>
<li>2 tsps coriander powder</li>
<li>1 tsp cumin powder</li>
<li>1 tsp garam masala powder</li>
<li>1/2 tsp turmeric powder</li>
<li>1/2 tsp red chilli powder</li>
<li>Salt to taste</li>
<li>2 potatoes cut into 1" cubes (optional)</li>
<li>Chopped fresh coriander leaves to garnish</li>
<li>2 green chillies, slit lengthwise, to garnish with (optional)</li>
</ul>


<b> Preparation: </b>
<ol type="1">

 <li>Heat 2 tbsps of the cooking oil in a deep pan and when hot, add the onions. Fry till slightly golden. Turn off the fire. Use a slotted spoon to remove the onions from the pan and put them in a food processor. Grind the onions, tomatoes, green chillies into a smooth paste. Try not to add water while grinding, if possible.</li>

 <li>Heat the remaining oil in the same pan and add the paste you just made to it when it is hot. Fry for 2-3 minutes.</li>

<li>Add the ginger and garlic pastes, all the dry spices - coriander powder, cumin powder, garam masala powder, turmeric powder and red chilli powder - then mix and fry till the oil begins to separate from the masala (onion-tomato-spice mix).</li>

<li>Now add 2 cups of warm water to this masala and bring to a boil on a medium flame. If adding potatoes to the curry, add them now and cook till half done.</li>

<li>Half slit the boiled eggs vertically and add them gently to the gravy. Simmer the flame and cook for 10 minutes or till the gravy is thickened/ reduced to about 3/4 of the original quantity (when you added the water). If you have added potatoes they should ideally be cooked by now.</li>

<li>Turn off the fire and garnish with chopped coriander leaves and the slit green chillies (if using). Serve hot with plain boiled Basmati rice and a vegetable side dish.</li>
